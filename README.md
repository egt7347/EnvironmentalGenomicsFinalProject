# README.md `Environmental_Genomics_Final_Project`

This repository is a collection of all the code used to reanalyze "Surviving marginalized reefs: assessing the implications of the microbiome on coral physiology and survivorship" by Roitman et al. 2020. Comparing the outputs from two different pipelines, the original paper using an older version of QIIME and the UCLUST/USEARCH algorithm, and my analysis using QIIME2 and more recently updated packages, shows just how much the field of environmental genomics has changed in just a few years. In addition, this reanalysis shows the difference between using ASVs and OTUs to identify 16S rRNA V4 sequences. The results from this reanalysis highlight the importance of periodically reanalysing collected data to more accurately idnetify sequences and to be able to make comparisons between older microbial composition and new research and can also help scientists draw conclusions on how microbiomes are changing over time. 

# GitHub Repository
Here is all of the code for both the pipeline I used to analyse sequences in QIIME2-2024.2 and all of the code used to perform statistical analysis in R (v4.4.1).
